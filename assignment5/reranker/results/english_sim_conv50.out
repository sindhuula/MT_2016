stories of fraud on the exams in school and college - it 's the usual thing .
mentors who to teach the opposite , sends a message that the lies and fraud are appropriate .
studies have shown that within a single day , you can lie from 10 up to 200 times .
another study found that total strangers , солгали three times in the first 10 minutes get acquainted with each other .
in contrast to the room of the game , like , say , charades , where you exclaim , " caught ! " detection of lies is a serious direction knowledge , based on scientific data , collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities , comprehensive research projects , particularly in psychology and physiology .
is not from this draw the conclusion that liars is hard to notice and it is hard to expose .
i spent a few years , examining the scientific discoveries of the vast and ever - growing segment of knowledge about the lies , and it is clear that detection of lies - modern skill , which is easy to learn and that helps in our complex world -- in the interview , especially if your professional duties include recruiting , negotiation or management .
we know from research that extroverts lied more frequently than introverts that men are more lie about themselves , while women -- about others , usually to protect someone 's feelings that married people lied to its partners , less than unmarried ( but the lies , that they say , often наглая ) .
watch позой , a laugh , voice characteristics of your object .
rats can fix the top of his body , when they try to remember their history , they can put their feet towards the door , bend towards the exit , change its position in a certain way or to demonstrate " relief after the interview " -- is this exaggerated sigh of relief and a change in posture , when all the complicated issues behind us .
привирающие people may also use disengagement in the speech : " i did n't have sexual relations with that woman miss lewinsky ... " or repeat a complex question completely .
someone can use the " qualification language " , when answering the complicated issue : " well ... the truth ... as far as i know ... as far as i know it . "
there is no magical means deception detection , to detect the lies , but to master the skill you can .
