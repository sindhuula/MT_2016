school employees union , representing hundreds of staff , who lost their seats in last month , plans to sue the city on wednesday , arguing that the layoffs were not needed and were discriminatory because of the disproportionate influence on the school , where poor students .
six hundred and seventy - two school assistant coordinator , working with parents and other officials , who were among the most low - wage workers in the city , lost their seats on october 7 , as a result of that union leaders called the political reaction to their refusal to give city workers ' access to health care funds , managed by groups , to close a hole in the budget last spring .
at a hearing in the city council last month , the schools chancellor dennis m. уолкотт said that the layoffs were part of the budget , which they signed in june .
representatives of the district council 37 , said that they have with the notice claims , the department of education , warning that filed a lawsuit against him ; on wednesday will be held a press conference to announce a formal file a lawsuit in state supreme court in manhattan .
elizabeth thomas , a spokesman for the city 's legal department , said that city had not seen the lawsuit and therefore could not comment on its specific provisions .
he points out that , while the статен - island layoffs was not , and schools in the upper east side , there was little or трибеки them , 17 school support workers have lost their seats in the district 23 in браунсвилле , brooklyn , and 46 in the south bronx , was forced to resign in districts 8 and 9 .
p.s. 36th 3,26 per cent was scrapped in budget this year , and it also lost money , when the city has changed the way of counting additional funding for each poor student , who is enrolled in school .
the notification , used the word " excess " , although the " excessive " more often , when a teacher from payroll school moves in the list of available workers , wages , which pays for the central office .

" what this resolution is to give honours отважному people of libya , when they begin to rebuild their country , " said kerry .
language may seem harmless , but still no discussion on libya was not easy .
kerry and mccain introduced a resolution in june , allows limited use of american forces in libya .
but the same day , when the bill failed in the house of representatives , the chamber also supported a proposal that would not cut funding for u.s. operations in libya .
resolution " admires the people of libya 's foreign affairs committee for his incredible bravery and formidable resistance in the quest for freedom " and thanked the men and women of the united states armed forces and their coalition partners , who participated in the military operation to protect the libyan people for their formidable courage and professionalism . "
whether the new measures will receive full support of the council on foreign affairs or расколют legislators , as the june bill ?
representative люгера said monday that he had not yet seen the latest version of the bill .
this measure , proposed a member of the u.s. house of representatives , republican bob гудлатом ( virginia ) , will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or about anything else that will be on the plenary vote of congress this session .
поправка гудлата - just one of the 68 constitutional amendments , affecting a wide range of issues , which were made in this meeting .
there are at least 15 versions of the balanced budget amendment only in the house of representatives and much else about the " control over federal spending . "
the budget control act , which was held in august , and demanded that the house of representatives , and the senate voted for a balanced budget amendment .
in addition to the budget , some congressmen want to limit the number of terms of members of congress , jose serrano , a democrat and member of the house of representatives , new york ) wants to abolish the limit of two terms for president .
amendment banning same - sex marriages already offer many years , and another banning burning the flag .
no matter how eager members of congress to propose amendments , they are not faster , than in past years .
this rate pales in comparison with the beginning of the 1990s , when members of congress , according to the library of the senate , regularly offered more than 150 amendments to every two years .
the latest amendment , which was adopted , a 27 - i - was approved by parliament in 1992 , but in the congress , she was actually in 1789 .
ten months later , after an armed man shot in her emphasis on public event in tucson , a member of the democratic party , representative gabrielle giffords ( ariz. ) on monday evening , appeared on federal channel подпела melody from бродвейского show " the sun will return tomorrow and said that " wants to get better , more than to return to congress .
program has shown its bumpy recovery from injuries inflicted by a bullet , which раздробила пробила left side of the brain and skull , going from front to rear their heads .

interviews with giffords and her husband , astronaut mark kelly , was part of the hour " 20/20 " special edition , which was shown on the eve of the new book " гэбби spouses : the story of courage and hope . "
the video , kelly in the first few weeks , she lies on a hospital bed with a shaved head and a long scar on forehead .
we see a few months later , as giffords sat in the stroller , and physiotherapists teach her how to perform the simple actions .
a few days later , giffords said the second word - " toast " to change , request breakfast menu .

completely opposite impression illustrate the uneasy relationship that developed between the army and often indifferent , sometimes восхищенной american audience .
" we are not victims , " said brigadier general sean b. mcfarland , who commanded troops in iraq , and went to afghanistan as soon as possible .
this is a very sensitive topic for commanders , who do not want to seem ungrateful or несогласными with society , which they serve .
as a result , most conversations about the pity is quietly and alone among combat veterans .
some will look at them with admiration , because they smash the rebels and used in exotic locations .
while looking for work , he says , he felt that some interviewers cautiously asked whether he will be able to withstand the strain responsible for work in washington immediately after the military campaign .
uneasy , military , which are partly comes from the american indifference to the wars .
" we do n't value , as a nation , more military heroism , as it was quite usual in world war ii , " says david бэрноу , retired lieutenant - general who commanded u.s. troops in afghanistan .
troops are on the number of trips , which they committed , the number of associates , which they lost , or on the scale of losses .

burke says she choses the upper echelons of the army because the problem begins with them .
" those people who , which can destroy cult of violence ? " senior leadership " .
her strategy : instead of collecting all of the plaintiffs in this case is putting all your eggs in one basket , so to speak , " she will open many cases , if necessary , in order to maintain the pressure .
court documents , which has received newsweek , the strategy is basically a protection that current or former soldiers cannot claims for damages incurred by the army in the armed forces .
" the plaintiffs ' damage refers to the risk , присущему military service , " said the documents .
and soldiers in iraq and afghanistan , women 's team - playing an increasingly important role , especially in contact with local women in combat zone .
seminar at yale law school veterans legal services is preparing a case against four major military academies on the charges of encouraging женоненавистнической atmosphere .

in this report , published in march , as well as the percentage of prosecutions : in 2010 , the 20 percent of known cases reached court - twice in less than in the civil justice system .
in the case of лайман rape , she said in a military police less than an hour later , after it happened .

six people have a positive characteristics of the accused , who was ultimately acquitted .
" i thought i was now a " i ran out of the courtroom screaming . "

продвинется will forward the case , the lyman and her comrades on the claim , is a complicated question , " says john turley , professor of law in the name of george washington university school of law .
between them and the verdict is the doctrine , which has criticized since she appeared .
army had lagged for decades , because it does not have those incentives and impeding the funds , which imposes liability .
these things will change only when the brave people willing to fight .
" we will continue to fight the army so far on this issue , will not be reform , " she says .
on monday , breivik , suspected of committing mass murder in norway in july , which has taken the lives of 77 people , appeared at his first open the hearing .
after years of tragedy , the researchers wanted to learn more about these people .
supply of personal data on facebook is so great , " says bartlett , the researchers could easily use the site 's advertising tool , to highlight the demographic group , with scientific precision that marketers and make a few years .
with facebook bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview more than 10,000 members of the 14 extreme right - wing parties in 11 european countries - not even out of office .
some not - so results are striking : online - male supporters of right - wing groups -- often young people , unhappy with immigration .
the demos - just one example of how facebook is becoming a new popular instrument in the hands of scientists .
with more than 800 million active users , add an average of three entries in the day , " super - hot information research boom , " facebook is increasing the number of scientific articles with the name of the site in the title on the 800 percent over the past five years .
" previously , if you want to interview people from the british national party , would be very difficult to identify them . "
" facebook does this all - you to contact him directly . "
recent research by dr. megan moreno from the university of wisconsin , madison , and her colleagues found that students who discussed his drunken exploits on facebook , were much more at risk of alcoholism than students who were silent on this issue .
" you ca n't solve the problem , not her , " said washington post димитри выявив христакис moreno , the co - author and director of the center for child health , behavior and development , and in the seattle children 's research institute .
facebook also constantly pulls all sorts of data about its users .
but facebook users know that the site , watching them , they like it or not - for the opportunity to play in скраббл , located in the thousands of miles away from you , the site can handle your personal data .
while researchers have strictly defined rules for offline data research , online publicity .

even offline , there is no guarantee that a very honest research .
" what you say on facebook , and the fact that you do outside of facebook , are two completely different things , " said selwin .
" nothing can replace the real world and interacting with real people , " he says .

for the same reason , he refused to allow брейвику , which has brought with it a pre - written speech , go to the relatives of victims at the end of the hearing .
about 30 survivors and victims ' relatives attended the hearing .
" it was uncomfortable , but personally , i was a little easier , after i saw and heard the suspect . "
despite breivik 's a strange idea about what he is part of a " resistance " movement , a judge ruled that he is not crazy , and said that there is no evidence that he had acted with accomplices .
but that does not lessen the grief and confusion , which now feels the whole nation .

by that time , about 10 years have passed since jobs from apple , and he had already worked out in his new computer company next in anticipation of the mass of the internet .
only after the death of jobs and complete vhs copy of the director was found in the garage .

he has a vision of how things could and should have been .
" during the period of time in the business i constantly asked : " why are you doing this ? " and the answers you invariably get : " oh , this is just done exactly that . "
stung by way of recording expenses , often начинавшейся expenditure with the " standard " , which took from the ceiling and then подгонялись with a " clarification " , he has created automated framework , which guaranteed that they will be able to track business expenses until the details .
jobs in detail about " blue box " , which he смастерил with steve wozniak , a device that allowed people to effectively взламывать long - distance telephone company and call for free .

" we were young , and all that we have learned is that we can build something that would have control of the billions of dollars on infrastructure around the world . "
jobs continues to describe one famous escapade , in detail with which he and wozniak almost did , calling the vatican through a blue box at midnight and asking to call the pope , struggling to copy , henry kissinger .
about the love of technology ( and cold прозванивании bill хьюлетта ) :

i often travelled to hp as a teenager and it revolved around the car and wrote for the program .

scalia and thomas обедают with foes of the health care law , while the court considers the case
this incident took place last thursday , when all nine justices met to discuss filed petitions for review .
judges have agreed to consider the process ; in fact , behalterbau debate lasting in 5 1/2 hours are expected in march 2012 , but the outcome will likely become a hindrance in the presidential race , which will be in full swing by the time , when a court decision .
firm clement , bancroft pllc , was one of the nearly two dozen firms , which helped sponsor annual lunch society , long - existing groups , federalists constantly отстаивающей conservative legal principles .
another event was sponsored by pharmaceutical giant pflizer inc , which is a huge financial interest in the outcome of litigation .
present , among others , in the senate republican leader mitch mcconnell , and well - known opponent of the healthcare law .
nothing new : two judges attend the event society федералистов for many years .
in fact , the judges are free from the code of conduct , which regulates the actions of the lower federal judges .
nevertheless , the sheer intimacy scalia and thomas to two legal firms in this case , as well as to companies with big financial interests , was enough to signal to activists of ethics in government .
" judges wined and dined on the official campaign to raise money with the lawyers whose cases are now in court . "
scalia and thomas is unlikely to pay attention to critics who say they are very eager to mix business with the court фигурирующими society in matters of groups like the federalists .

" so , would make such a strong contraction , the majority of our construction projects on кораблестроению and unfulfilled -- you ca n't buy a three - quarters of a ship or the building -- and will seriously damage other modernization efforts , " panetta wrote senators .
" these changes will undermine the credibility of those who support our army and will seriously damage combat readiness . "

a cursory glance at recent headlines , shows just how serious and повсеместны deception and lies in everyday life .
administration at the university of pennsylvania was charged with лжесвидетельствовании schlensker , because they allegedly hid that retired football coach raped young boys .
former presidential candidate john edwards was indicted in financial fraud during the campaign , involving укрывательством extramarital affairs .
stories about the fraud charges on the exams in school and college - this is business as usual .
mentors , who must teach the opposite , send a message that the lies and fraud are acceptable .
studies have shown that within a single day , you can lie from 10 up to 200 times .
another study showed that strangers солгали three times for the first 10 minutes to get acquainted with each other .
in contrast to the games room , like , say , charades , where you exclaim , " caught ! " to identify lies is a serious kind of knowledge , based on scientific data , collected over the past six decades in the prestigious universities , comprehensive research projects , particularly in psychology and physiology .
not from this hard to notice and it is difficult to draw the conclusion that the liars .
i spent several years , examining the scientific discoveries of the vast and ever - growing segment of knowledge about lie detection , and it is clear that modern skill , which is easy to learn and that helps us in our complex in the world -- especially if your professional duties include recruiting , interviewing , negotiating or management .
we know from studies that extroverts lied more frequently than introverts , and that the men lie about yourself , whereas women -- more about the other , usually in order to protect someone 's feelings that married people lied to their partners , less than unmarried ( but the lie , that they say , often наглая ) .
watch позой , laughter , voice your subject characteristics .
rats can fix the upper part of his body , when they try to remember their history , they can put their feet towards the door , bend towards the exit , to change its position in a certain way , or " relief after the interview " -- this exaggerated sigh of relief and a change in posture , when all the complex issues behind us .
привирающие people can also use the disengagement in the speech : " i did not have sexual relations with that woman miss lewinsky " or repeat a complicated question entirely . ...
someone could use the " qualification " language , when answering a question : " well ... to tell the truth ... as far as i know ... as far as i know it . "
there is no magic money , to expose the lie , but to master the skill of deception detection can be .
