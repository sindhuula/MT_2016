police said that tents not to be touched until 1:45 a.m. , giving the protesters time to collect things .
but many journalists argue that they did n't see how the police , and that the police treated them rudely .
when police went to the west through a pile of personal belongings antifiltration protesters , including bags , plastic mats and bags full of clothing , the health department followed the team , it was collecting what брошено .
the main group of protesters took positions near the kitchen camp , the center of the park .

school employees union , representing hundreds of staff , who lost their seats in last month , plans to sue the city on wednesday , arguing that the layoffs were not needed and were discriminatory because of the disproportionate influence on the school , where poor students .
six hundred and seventy - two school assistant coordinator , working with parents and other employees who were among the most low - wage workers in the city , have lost their place on 7 october as a result of that union leaders called the political reaction to them refusing to give the city access to health care funds , managed by groups of workers , to close a hole in the budget last spring .
at a hearing in the city council last month , the schools chancellor dennis m. уолкотт said that the layoffs were part of the budget , which they signed in june .
representatives of the district council 37 , said that they have with the notice claims , the department of education , warning that filed a lawsuit against him ; on wednesday will be held a press conference to announce a formal file a lawsuit in state supreme court in manhattan .
elizabeth thomas , a spokesperson for the city 's legal department , said that the city have n't seen the lawsuit and therefore cannot comment on its specific provisions .
he points out that , while the статен - island layoffs was not , and schools in the upper east side , there was little or трибеки them , 17 school support workers have lost their seats in the district 23 in браунсвилле , brooklyn , and 46 in the south bronx , was forced to resign in districts 8 and 9 .
p.s. 36th 3,26 per cent was scrapped in budget this year , and it also lost money , when the city has changed the way of counting additional funding for each poor student , who is enrolled in school .

" what this resolution is , to give honours отважному people of libya , when they begin to rebuild their country , " kerry said .
language may seem harmless , but still no discussion on libya was not easy .
in june , kerry and mccain introduced the resolution , allowing limited use of american forces in libya .
but in that same day , when the bill failed in the house of representatives , the chamber also has not supported a proposal which would cut funding for the u.s. mission in libya .
resolution " admires the people of libya 's foreign affairs committee for his incredible bravery and formidable resistance in the quest for freedom " and thanked the men and women of the united states armed forces and their coalition partners , who participated in military operations to protect the libyan people for their unusual courage and professionalism .

this measure , proposed a member of the u.s. house of representatives bob гудлатом ( a republican , virginia ) , will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or about anything else , which will be on the plenary vote in congress this session .
поправка гудлата - just one of the 68 constitutional amendments , affecting a wide range of issues , which were made in this meeting .
there are at least 15 versions of the balanced budget amendments only in the house of representatives and much else about the " control over federal spending . "

amendment banning same - sex marriage offer for many years , as well as another , banning burning the flag .
no matter how tried to find members of congress propose amendments , they are no faster than in previous years .
this rate pales in comparison with the beginning of the 1990s , when members of congress , according to the library of the senate , regularly offered more than 150 amendments every two years .
the latest amendment , which was adopted , the 27 - i - was approved by parliament in 1992 , but in congress it was actually in 1789 .

some people will look at them with admiration , because they smash the insurgents and were in exotic locations .
while looking for work , he says , he felt that some interviewers asked carefully , he will be able to withstand the strain responsible for work in washington , d.c. , immediately after the military campaign .
uncomfortable , that military experience , partly comes from american indifference to the wars .

" it was uncomfortable , but personally , i was a little easier , after i saw and heard the suspect . "
despite breivik 's a strange idea about what it is part of the " resistance " movement , the judge ruled that he 's not a mad , and said that there is no evidence that he acted with accomplices .
but that does not lessen the grief and confusion , which now feels the whole nation .

[ but ] a great idea from the great product separates a large number of ingenious labour . "
by that time , about 10 years have passed since jobs from apple , and he had already worked out in his new computer company next in anticipation of the mass of the internet .
only after the death of jobs and complete vhs copy of the director was found in the garage .
for a man , known for his hatred of detailed interviews , jobs seems to be here quite ready to present their technological philosophy and business strategy .
in four different points during an interview there are large intervals between questions and answers - where jobs is clearly weighing on 10-15 seconds , their thoughts to say .

he has a vision of how things could and should have been .
" during the period of time in the business i constantly asked : " why are you doing this ? " and the answers you invariably get : " oh , this is just done exactly that . "

" we were young , and all that we have adopted , this is what we can build something that could control billions of dollars on infrastructure around the world . "
jobs continues to describe one famous escapade , in detail with which he and wozniak almost did , calling the vatican through blue telephone box at midnight and asking for the pope , struggling to henry kissinger 's copy .

scalia and thomas обедают with opponents of the health care law , as long as the court considering the case
this incident took place in the last thursday , when all nine justices met to discuss filed petitions for review .
judges have agreed to consider the process ; in fact , behalterbau debate lasting in 5 1/2 hours are expected in march 2012 , but the outcome will likely become a hindrance in the presidential race , which will be in full swing by the time , when a court decision .
firm clement , bancroft pllc , was one of the nearly two dozen firms , which helped sponsor annual lunch society , long - existing groups , federalists constantly отстаивающей conservative legal principles .
another event was sponsored by pharmaceutical giant pflizer inc , which is a huge financial interest in the outcome of litigation .
attended , among others , mitch mcconnell , senate republican leader and a prominent opponent of health care law .
nothing new : two judges attend the event society федералистов for many years .
in fact , the judges are free from the code of conduct , which regulates the actions of the lower federal judges .
nonetheless , the sheer proximity to scalia and thomas two legal firms in this case , as well as the company to big financial interests , was enough to signal for activists of ethics in government .
" judges wined and dined on the official campaign fundraising with lawyers , which now covers the court . "
scalia and thomas is unlikely to pay attention to the critics who say they are very willing to mix business with the court фигурирующими in matters of groups like the federalist society .

defense secretary leon panetta tempers in congress on monday , warning that expected automatic budget cuts will undermine national security and will bring financial chain reaction from the pentagon corridors to the fields of battle in afghanistan on the line and civil assembly .
" the consequences of these cuts will be devastating for the state department , " panetta said in a letter to senators республиканцу республиканке john mccain , arizona and lindsey graham , south carolina .
" so , will make such a strong decline , the majority of our construction projects on кораблестроению and unfulfilled -- you ca n't buy a three - quarters of the ship or buildings -- and do serious damage other modernization efforts , " panetta wrote senators .
" these changes will undermine the credibility of those who support our army and will seriously damage combat readiness . "
" while foreign military financing in the emergency operations does not directly affected секвестром , the military to be severely affected by serious breakdown in the main budgets , " panetta warned .
" staff would be reduced , which will lead to опозданиям staff with military suppliers , and the legal and political support will be disturbed . "
" the consequences of sequestration in the department of defense will be a rapid decline in the united states as the world 's leading military power . "
" this is not an option , with which we live in , and this is not an option , which we need to impose ourselves . "
whether panetta letter or recent warnings from senators will lead to the pentagon 's budget compromise or strengthen calls for release from cutbacks , will see later .
at a press conference last week , defense secretary painted a gloomy picture of what may be followed by further troops -- with shell , but without the nucleus .
" this is a paper tiger , the army to barracks , buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers able to accomplish the mission , " panetta said in his introductory remarks in the pentagon .
and panetta said that some of the biggest defense project may encounter obstacles , including those that passed the tests , and some only on the early stages of planning .
halt to further develop and test f 35 can save $ 80 billion over 10 years , but his supporters say , that is a vital next step , in order to improve and to counter potential threats , china and other opponents .
a cursory glance at recent headlines , shows just how serious and повсеместны deception and lies in everyday life .
administration at the university of pennsylvania was charged in лжесвидетельствовании schlensker , because they allegedly attempted to hide that a retired football coach raping boys .
former presidential candidate john edwards was charged in the financial machinations during the campaign , involving укрывательством extramarital affairs .
stories about the fraud on the tests in school and college is the norm .
mentors who should teach the opposite , send a message that the lies and fraud are acceptable .
studies have shown that within a single day , you can lie from 10 up to 200 times .
another study showed that strangers солгали three times for the first 10 minutes to get acquainted with each other .
in contrast to the room of the game , like , say , charades , where you exclaim , " caught ! " detection of lies is a serious direction knowledge , based on scientific data , collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities , comprehensive research projects , particularly in psychology and physiology .
not from this hard to notice and it is difficult to draw the conclusion that liars .
i spent a few years , examining the scientific discoveries of the vast and ever - growing segment of knowledge about lie detection , and it is clear that modern skill , which is easy to learn and that helps in meaningful in our complex world -- especially if your professional duties include recruiting , interviewing , negotiating or management .
we know from research that extroverts lied more frequently than introverts , that men lie about yourself , whereas women -- more about the other , usually in order to protect someone 's feelings , that married people lied to its partners , less than unmarried ( but the lie that they say , often наглая ) .
watch позой , laughter , voice your subject characteristics .
rats can fix the upper part of his body , when they try to remember their history , they can put their feet towards the door , bend towards the exit , to change its position in a certain way , or " relief after the interview " -- this exaggerated sigh of relief and a change in posture , when all the complex issues behind us .
привирающие people can also use disengagement in the speech : " i have n't had sexual relations with that woman miss lewinsky " or repeat a complicated question entirely . ...
someone can use the " qualification " language , when answering a question : " well ... the truth ... as far as i know ... as far as i know . "
there is no magical means to detect lies , but to master the skill can detect deception .

the administration headed by former european commissioner monti should approve the austerity package , demanded that european leaders to restore confidence in italy .
emma марчегалия , leader of the italian employers ' federation , told reporters after meeting with monti : " we were told that we will actively support this government " .
monti 's chances of success were largely based on the ldp 's support of the party of silvio berlusconi , who was forced to resign on saturday because of the economic crisis .
